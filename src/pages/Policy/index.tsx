          this respect, the information provided by you for the purposes
          mentioned above, and to the extent necessary for the processing of
          your order or request, is exchanged with affiliate / partner

          cookies (e.g. Google AdWords cookie) document your previous visits to
          third-party websites whose providers have joined the Google Display

          optimized, and promoted through ad settings. Through the analysis of
          third-party cookies (e.g. AdWords cookies) we are able to better
          tailor our online advertising campaigns to you and your interests. In

          advertising features such as remarketing, Google Display Network
          impressions reports, or Google Analytics demographics and interest
          reports. Google will also transfer this information to third parties

          cookies set are a "Visitor Cookie", an "Opt-In Cookie" and a "Pardot

          The identification number is a generated numerical code that has no

          For your protection we use the service invisible reCAPTCHA of the
          company Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA
          94043, United States ("Google"). The query serves to differentiate
          whether the input is made by a person or abusively by automated
          machine processing. The query includes sending the IP address and any
          other data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service to Google. For
          this purpose your input will be transmitted to Google and used there.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, if IP anonymization is activated on this website, Google will
          reduce your IP address within Member States of the European Union or
          in other countries party to the Agreement on the European Economic
          Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be
          transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On our
          behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of this
          service. The IP address transmitted by your browser within the scope
          of reCAPTCHA is not merged with other Google data.
          <br />

          The deviating data protection regulations of the company Google apply
          to this data. For more information about Google's privacy policy,

          We would like to point out that IP anonymization is active on this
          site in order to guarantee anonymous collection of IP addresses
          (so-called IP masking).
          <br />
          <br />
          The use of invisible reCAPTCHA is based on Art. 6 para. 1 letter a)
          GDPR. With confirmation of the inquiry you give us your consent to
          data processing. In any case, data processing is permissible pursuant
          to Art. 6 para. 1 letter f) GDPR; the query serves to protect access
          and is intended to ensure human action. It is therefore in our
          legitimate interest.

        <p>
          This website includes content from the service YouTube. These features
          are offered through YouTube, LLC 901 Cherry Ave. San Bruno, CA 94066

          uses it to capture video statistics, prevent fraud, and improve
          usability. This also leads to a connection with the Google Double
