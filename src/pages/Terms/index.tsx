        <p>
          The Services may contain links to websites and applications operated
          by parties other than Fairday Jobs. Such links are provided for User’s
          reference only, and Fairday Jobs does not control such websites and is
          not responsible for their content. Fairday Jobs’s inclusion of any
          links to such websites or applications does not imply any endorsement
          of the material on such websites or applications or any association
          with their operators. Fairday Jobs assumes no liability whatsoever for
          any such third-party websites, applications or any content, features,
          products, or services made available through such third-party websites
          or applications. Additionally, Apple Inc., Google, Inc., Microsoft

        </p>
        <h1>Severability</h1>
        <p>
          If any of the provisions, or portions thereof, of this Agreement are
          found to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, then,
          that provision (or portion thereof) notwithstanding, this Agreement
          shall remain in full force and effect and such provision or portion
          thereof shall be deemed omitted.
        </p>
        <h1>3. Assignment </h1>
        <p>
          This Agreement and the rights granted and obligations undertaken
          hereunder may not be transferred, assigned, or delegated in any manner
          by User, but may be freely transferred, assigned, or delegated by
          Fairday Jobs.
        </p>
        <h1>3. Waiver</h1>
        <p>
          Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or a delay by any party
          in the enforcement of any right hereunder, shall neither be construed
          as a continuing waiver nor create an expectation of non-enforcement of
          that or any other provision or right.
        </p>
        <h1>14. Arbitration</h1>
        <p>
          THIS IS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER, CLASS ACTION
          WAIVER, AND FORUM SELECTION CLAUSE.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you are a resident of the United States (including its possessions
          and territories) or Canada, you agree that any and all controversies,
          disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the
          interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the
          controversy, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action)
          between you and the Fairday Jobs Parties or their successors or
          assigns shall exclusively be settled through binding and confidential
          arbitration.
          <br />
          <br />
          Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not
          any state or provincial/territorial arbitration law. The arbitration
          shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial
          experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American
          Arbitration Association (“AAA”). As modified by this Agreement, and
          unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the
          arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules
          and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary
          Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and
          Procedures”).
          <br />
          <br />
          In the case of arbitration and where permitted by law, you are thus
          agreeing to GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your
          rights EXCEPT for matters that you file in small claims court. Your
          rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or
          jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration
          procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN
          COURT. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and
          are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
        </p>
        <h1>15. Purchases </h1>
        <p>

          We reserve the right to refuse and/or cancel your order at any time
          for reasons including, but not limited to: product or service
          availability, errors in the description or price of the product or

          we reserve the right to refuse and/or cancel your order if fraud or

          pay all amounts due upon demand. Following any such non-payment, we
          may require you to provide a second valid credit card before
          continuing to use the Services. You authorize us to charge outstanding
          fees and other amounts due to Us against any credit card you have on
          file with us. We reserve the right to take all steps necessary to
          collect amounts due from you, including but not limited to legal

          of any price change. If We modify any of the foregoing terms, you may
          cancel your membership, and such cancellation shall be your sole
          remedy. We may provide notice of any such changes by email, notice to

        <p>
          Purchase Price and Monthly Subscription. By purchasing a Monthly
          Subscription (if applicable), you agree to an initial purchase price
          (if applicable) and recurring Monthly Subscription, and you accept
          responsibility for all recurring charges until you cancel your
          subscription. You may cancel your Monthly Subscription at any time,
          subject to the terms of our cancellation policy.
          <br />
          <br />
          - Automatic Monthly Renewal Terms: Once you subscribe and are off the
          waitlist, we will process your Monthly Subscription fee in the next
          billing cycle. We will continue to automatically process your Monthly
          Subscription fee each month at the then-current Monthly Subscription
          rate, until you cancel your Monthly Subscription. You can cancel your
          subscription at any time through your accounts subscriptions page.
          Your payment is non-refundable. Your Service will continue until the

          your payment information and are charged the Monthly Subscription. If
          You do not renew within 30 days of expiration, then You forfeit the
